# Implementation of Imbalanced Algorithms :rocket:
### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: What is this?

This final paper has been made by @viniciusnicoleli and @felipearaujolima! 
This is an open source of a lot of different methods that we got reading the most updated methods to take on imbalanced data.
which is very commom between different areas to have imbalanced data.

### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Introduction of a totally new method!

@felipearaujolima created a new method from scratch based on a ideia that he proposed which it is a good aproach for
imbalanced datasets.

### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Main Objective?

This Repo aims to get different methods and test them to check which one performs better with a given dataset.
We have some methods to make sure you will be able to decide which one of them you should prefer.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: How was it build?

Mainly build using Python and one of the methods was build using R (HDDT).

Some methods we got from different packages that already got implemented, for example from smote-variants (SVM balance,MCT,DBSMOTE).
the others methods, were all implemented by @felipearaujolima, which made the Python scripts.

### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: How to use it?

To use this repo make sure to clone it, once you got it, you can freely use it by importing from it, or even copying the codes 
For now we don't have the intention to drop it as a package...
